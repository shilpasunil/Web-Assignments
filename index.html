  WHAT ARE CHATBOTS?
  </h2>
  <p> Bots are man-made reasoning frameworks that communicate with clients by means of informing,
     text, or discourse. They're being utilized on sites, just as on stages like Facebook Courier,
     WhatsApp, Slack, WeChat, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. They permit organizations to
     move correspondence with their clients or possible clients forward without human cooperation. </p>

  <p> Like the endearingly firm robots we've seen in endless films – disastrous, miserable machines
    tormented by their agonizingly confined enthusiastic reach, uselessly expecting to achieve a more
     prominent level of humanity – chatbots frequently solid practically
    human, however not exactly. Their discourse is abnormal, the cadence some way or another off.</p>
<img class="image-1" src="images/what.jpg" alt="what-are-chatbots-1">
<p>All things considered, a bot is just tantamount to its programming and client input permit it to
be. Moreover, bots require preparing. Complete mechanization or simulated intelligence trade for
 client assistance isn't practical as of now. Nonetheless, we've taken jumps and limits in an
 extremely brief timeframe.</p>

 <p>Although chatbot technology is unmistakably different from natural language processing
    technology, the previous can just truly progress as fast as the last mentioned; without
    continued developments in NLP, chatbots remain at the helpless at algorithms’ current ability
    to distinguish the unobtrusive subtleties in both written and spoken dialogue.</p>

    <p>This is the place where most uses of NLP battle, and not simply chatbots.
       Any framework or application that depends upon a machine's capacity to parse
       human discourse is probably going to battle with the complexities characteristic in
       elements of speech such as metaphors and similes. Regardless of these significant
       restrictions, chatbots are getting progressively complex, responsive, and more natural.</p>

       <p>Put another way, they’re becoming more human. 
       One may wonder why chatbots are gaining popularity!</p>
